# Project Review: Kangalos Backend

## 1. Technical Analysis

### Code Structure and Practices

- The project follows the NestJS module pattern. Modules contain controllers, services and DTOs. The `organisation` module is an example of a well documented implementation. Its service validates input via helper methods and returns a consistent response shape. Lines 32‑67 show the creation workflow with logging and duplicate checks【F:src/organisation/organisation.service.ts†L32-L67】.
- Common utility logic is extracted to `InfrastructureService` for tasks such as checking record existence, detecting duplicates and generating pagination metadata【F:src/infrastructure/infrastructure.service.ts†L13-L51】.
- Controllers leverage `ParseUUIDPipe` or the custom `UuidValidationPipe` to validate parameters. DTOs use `class-validator` and `@nestjs/swagger` decorators for documentation as seen in the `create-project.dto.ts` file【F:src/projects/dto/create-project.dto.ts†L16-L47】.
- Linting passes without warnings (see testing section), but the TypeScript type check fails due to missing generated Prisma client types and mismatched service properties (e.g., `attachment` not on `PrismaService`)【ecb0bf†L1-L97】. Addressing these type issues is necessary for production readiness.

### Prisma Usage & Performance

- The Prisma schema defines a comprehensive set of models representing organisation units, users, projects and related entities. For instance, the `Project` model stores status, progress percentage and relations to authors and funders【F:prisma/schema.prisma†L299-L332】.
- Services typically use Prisma’s `$transaction` for multi-step operations and `skip`/`take` for pagination. The organisation service builds a dynamic `where` object and computes pagination metadata to generate links【F:src/organisation/organisation.service.ts†L74-L158】. This approach is scalable but ensure database indexes exist for fields used in filtering (e.g., `organisation_unit_id`, `status`, `year` already indexed in the schema).
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` with a provided `.env.example` specifying configuration such as database credentials and JWT settings【F:.env.example†L1-L28】. Docker Compose uses these variables and sets `NODE_ENV=production` in the running container【F:compose.yaml†L1-L20】.

### Security Considerations

- Sensitive values are not checked in, and example values are provided via `.env.example`. Ensure secrets are stored securely in production (e.g., use Docker secrets or a secret manager).
- JWT secret and email credentials are present in `.env.example`; these should be replaced with strong values and never committed.
- The Prisma service is injected into each module, enabling parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Input validation uses `class-validator`. Ensure rate limiting and global exception filters are configured for additional security.

### Logging & Monitoring

- A custom logger module integrates with Winston and daily-rotate-file as described in `AGENTS.md`. Logs capture important events such as creation or deletion of organisation units. Compose config includes a healthcheck endpoint for container monitoring【F:compose.yaml†L20-L26】.

## 2. Project Context Analysis

- The README introduces Kangalos as an innovation management platform for the University of Rwanda【F:README.md†L1-L3】. It addresses fragmentation of project data and aims to centralise proposals and tracking【F:README.md†L5-L9】. Feature highlights include a flexible org chart, roles/permissions and project reports【F:README.md†L23-L39】.
- Diagrams and improvements documents outline system architecture and needed refinements. The improvements file recommends consistent API response formats, centralized error handling and enhanced Swagger documentation for several modules. Some modules still lack these improvements.
- The Prisma schema aligns well with the objectives described. Models capture organisational structure, stakeholders, funding and SDG alignment, which supports transparency and reporting.
- However, the README lacks setup instructions, local development steps and contribution guidelines, which are important for maintainability.

## 3. Recommendations

1. **Resolve TypeScript Errors**
   - Generate the Prisma client (`npm run prisma:generate`) so that imports from `src/generated/prisma` are valid and update the `PrismaService` type accordingly.
   - Ensure `PrismaService` exposes typed model properties (e.g., `prisma.attachment`). This will remove the numerous "Property X does not exist" errors during type checking.

2. **Enhance Security & Configurations**
   - Use strong, unique secrets in production and consider environment-specific config files. Leverage Docker secrets or a secret manager for credentials.
   - Implement global exception filters and request validation pipes at the app level. Add rate limiting middleware to mitigate brute-force attacks.

3. **Improve Documentation**
   - Extend the README with installation steps, running migrations (`npm run prisma:migrate:deploy`), and how to seed data. Include instructions for development vs. production deployments.
   - Document environment variables in more detail and provide example `curl` commands or API usage examples.

4. **Database & Schema Enhancements**
   - Consider adding fields for inventory or categories if products or resources are tracked. For example, the `Attachment` model could include a `checksum` field to detect duplicates and a `privacyLevel` enum to handle access control.
   - For `Project`, you might track `budget`, `startDate`, and `endDate` to support financial planning and scheduling.
   - Create an `ActivityLog` model to record user actions (project edits, approvals) for auditability.

5. **Endpoint Improvements**
   - Follow the standard API response format across all modules, as noted in `improvements.md`.
   - Provide paginated GET endpoints for large relations (e.g., `/projects/:id/authors`, `/projects/:id/reports`) using the pagination utility in `InfrastructureService`.
   - Add query filters for the `Stakeholder` endpoints to filter by organisation unit or role.

6. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Ensure indexes exist for frequently queried fields; the schema already indexes many columns like `organisationUnitId` and `status` but monitor query plans in production.
   - Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for read-heavy endpoints such as organisation hierarchies.
   - Containerize with multi-stage Docker builds to minimise image size and set proper resource limits in Docker Compose or Kubernetes when scaling out.

7. **Testing & CI**
   - Add unit and integration tests using Jest and supertest. Integrate with CI to run `npm run check-all` and tests on each commit.

Overall, the project demonstrates solid foundations with NestJS and Prisma, but resolving the TypeScript build issues, expanding documentation and implementing the recommended enhancements will make the backend more production-ready and maintainable.
